## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to conventions and whether or not the state turns to them when conventions are held there. I am also interested in looking at third party prevalence in America, such as where most people vote third party, what elections (national, gubernatorial, municipal) receive a bigger proportion of third party votes, and so on. Perhaps something even related to finance and politicians, where politicians choose to invest. Maybe something to do with federal spending and interest rates over time based on presidency and party. I am mainly concerned about how I will be able to formulate this as my skills in R are rudimentary, but I have no shortage of ideas as to what topics I would want to research and compile into a database.
